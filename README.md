# Ask Me

## The Goal

The objective of this project was to apply the skills I learned during the Dice app tutorial and build an app entirely on my own. There are no new concepts here, but I coded everything from scratch to reinforce my understanding. This project helped me gain confidence using Swift, UIKit, and Xcode independently.

## What I created

I built a Magic 8-Ball-style app that gives randomized answers to yes-or-no questions. Just ask your question, tap the button, and get a magical answer! With this app in your pocket, life’s tough decisions become a little easier — or at least more fun.
